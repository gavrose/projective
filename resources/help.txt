This project has been going well so far. I have been having fun figuring out how all the puzzle pieces fit together. I realized that I was attempting to add complex features when the base website isn't completed yet, so I refocused to the basic features. 

It is even more time consuming than I expected. Now that I have completed other finals, I have more time to focus on this.

Features to implement:
- view posts
- add comments on posts
- view comments
- make css look better
- ability to edit projects/posts
- ability to delete projects/posts/comments
- admin page to view recent projects/posts/comments

Potential features:
- ability for projects to be private
- images in posts
- profile pictures --> would have to store in DB?
